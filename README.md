# New-Mexico-Redistricting-Plan
Our school project using Linear Programming to determine the optimal arrangement for New Mexico's 3 congressional districts.
Read the Project Report for the details on the proposed solution and the methods used. 
The code and all files used are also included in order to keep our methods transparent.

The code and many other resources are taken from Dr. Austin Buchanan's page which can be found [here](https://github.com/AustinLBuchanan/Districting-Examples).

The New Mexico county graph is taken from [Daryl DeFord's website](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/dual_graphs), and the Oklahoma shapefiles are taken from [Eugene Lykhovyd's website](https://lykhovyd.com/files/public/districting). Both sites contain all 50 U.S. states.
